use

`cmake -S .. -B . -G "MinGW Makefiles"`

in the glfw/build directory on windows to rizz up the haters and probably
something different on linux like:

`cd glfw`
`mkdir build`
`cd build`
`cmake -S .. -B .`
`make`
`cd ../..`
`make`

to make like the entire project probably

(and then use make on the resulting Makefile)
